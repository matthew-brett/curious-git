Curious git
===========

A beginner's tutorial on git, in which we build a content management system
from scratch to show how git works.

Based on the ideas in `the git parable
<http://tom.preston-werner.com/2009/05/19/the-git-parable.html>`_.

The built web pages are at http://matthew-brett.github.io/curious-git
